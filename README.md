# 📸 Project Around React

## 📖 About the Project

Around React is an interactive photo-sharing platform where users can showcase their profiles and upload pictures.

The website includes the following features:

- Profile Section: Displays the user's name and description, with an option to edit these details.
- Photo Gallery: Users can add and delete photos, with a like functionality on posts. When the like button is clicked, it becomes filled.
- Pop-ups: All pop-ups can be closed by clicking outside of them or pressing the Esc key.
- Form Validation: Forms now have validation, and the "Save" button only becomes active when all fields are valid.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The code has been restructured with the implementation of classes, improving the organization and structure of the project.
- API Integration: The project integrates with an API to save data, using authenticated requests with an individual token. We also learned how to interpret the status and response object of requests.
- React: The project was restructured using React, where we learned about components, state, and lifecycle methods.
- State Management: The use of Context API was implemented to share information across different parts of the code, and Refs were used to access user input directly.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project was to build a dynamic and user-friendly photo-sharing platform, while deepening our understanding of JavaScript, React, OOP, and API integration. The focus was to improve the user experience through interactive elements and a structured approach to data handling.
